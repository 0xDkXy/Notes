## type/model checking
- It can occur either at compile time(static) or at executing time(dynamic)
- Type checking ensures the type-safety of a given program where there is a possibility of errors such as an integer operator applied to the string s or a float operation performed on an integer.
-  model checking verifies the given specification of a finite-state system.
