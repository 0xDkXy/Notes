Hence, it becomes essential for the developers and researchers to enhance the ability of protecting from attacks and the ways to find out the potent vulnerability.

Malware families that are popular are spyware, bots, Adware, Potentially Unwanted Applications, Trojans, and Trojan spyware. PUA is the topmost Android malware detect by Quick Heal. In 2016, Kaspersky Lab detected 128886 lakh mobile banking Trojans and abround 261214 mobile Ransomware Trojans. Gugi is an example of a banking Trojan that can exploit the security policeis of Android Marshmalow. The majority of malicious applications are designed to gain root access to the system, and the malware developers craft them so well that it is tough to detect them, and they keep on working in silence; users have no idea that the malware has endangered their system. After gaining control of these systems, these malicious applications can perform dangerous actions and can also infect other devices connected to the infected system. The developers of malicious applications are earning a considerable amount of money from this source. The Dark Web is one such example; it is a marketplace for criminals to buy and sell mobile malware, and the malware developers sell it as a component of software packages. On the Dark Web, malware and some other tools that are capable of evading many operating system like Android and iOS are available at a lower price, thereby gaining the interest of hackers and causing an increase in criminal activities. Malware has become a severe threat to modern society, which is increasingly becoming dependent on smart technologies for day-to-day activities. And the similar malware can also invade the OpenHarmony OS. Then make huge hurt to the users and the system. So it is necessary to find the way to protect users and operating system from attacks.

These vulnerabilities hiding in the system are the key or gate that usually make use of. The exploitation of permission, lack of awareness regarding security protocols, poor developer practices and coding skill, these are all possible factors that make vulnerability. So it is important to find the ways and methods to detect the vulnerability existing in the system efficiently. Reducing potential vulnerability and enhance the security mechanism could increase the difficulty that developers of malware to attack and steal users' privacy. That could protect the system and its' users efficiently.

At the heart of this technological landscape lies the operating system, a foundational element responsible for the device's seamless operation. However, its critical role renders it susceptible to attacks that seek to compromise its integrity. Therefore, it becomes imperative for developers and researchers to fortify its defenses against potential breaches and vulnerabilities.

The contemporary threat landscape includes various categories of malware, such as spyware, bots, adware, Trojans, and Trojan spyware. One notorious example is the Gugi banking Trojan, which exploits Android Marshmallow's security policies. The surge in mobile malware is evident, with instances like Kaspersky Lab detecting over 128,886 lakh mobile banking Trojans and approximately 261,214 mobile Ransomware Trojans in 2016 alone. The majority of these malicious applications aim to gain root access to the system and operate stealthily, evading detection and wreaking havoc unbeknownst to users. Such threats not only compromise the infected system but can also propagate to other interconnected devices. Malicious software developers exploit this scenario, profiting from their activities through avenues like the Dark Webâ€”a marketplace for trading mobile malware as components of software packages.

These menaces have now permeated modern society, where reliance on smart technologies for everyday activities is ubiquitous. The proposed research acknowledges the potential intrusion of such malware into the OpenHarmony OS, which could have severe implications for users and the system. Therefore, the research's overarching goal is to develop strategies to protect both users and the operating system from these pernicious attacks.

The vulnerabilities embedded within systems often serve as the gateways exploited by attackers. Factors such as permissions exploitation, lack of awareness about security protocols, poor developer practices, and coding deficiencies can all contribute to vulnerability. Consequently, the research strives to identify efficient methods for detecting these vulnerabilities and mitigating their impact. By reducing potential vulnerabilities and enhancing security mechanisms, the research aims to increase the complexity of attacks, making it more challenging for malware developers to compromise user privacy and system integrity.
