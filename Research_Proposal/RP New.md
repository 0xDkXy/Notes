### Project Objectives / Purpose of proposed investigation
#### origin

The proposed investigation delves into the sphere of computer security, with a specific focus on bolstering the safeguarding of mobile systems, particularly within OpenHarmony OS.  

In the past 10 years, with technological enhancements and spreading, the number of mobile devices has increase greatly. Mobile devices, like IoT devices and smartphone, have entered the people daily life already, both for the personal and professional aspects of their lives. Statista forecast that, by 2023, there will be 4.3 billion smartphone users. OpenHarmony is an open-source version of HarmonyOS donated by Huawei to the OpenAtom Foundation. It is an operating system that designed for the smartphone, and also for the Internet of Things, wireless routers, tablet computers and other smart terminal devices. After nearly 4 years developing, OpenHarmony now releases the 4th version. It becomes wider and wider usage. However, the security issues are always huge problems that all the developers and users should take care of.

The cost competitiveness in the smartphone market has also contributed to the growth of the number of the devices and has made smartphone available to the middle- and lower-income groups as well. This availability and the features of the latest smartphone have make the population dependent on these phones for their daily work, such as paying house-hold through phone banking or transferring essential documents.

The operating system is an integral part of these smartphones and is responsible for the functioning of the device, which makes it prone to attacks that take control of the device. Hence, it becomes essential for the developers and researchers to enhance the ability of protecting from attacks and the ways to find out the potent vulnerability.

Malware families that are popular are spyware, bots, Adware, Potentially Unwanted Applications, Trojans, and Trojan spyware. PUA is the topmost Android malware detect by Quick Heal. In 2016, Kaspersky Lab detected 128886 lakh mobile banking Trojans and abround 261214 mobile Ransomware Trojans. Gugi is an example of a banking Trojan that can exploit the security policeis of Android Marshmalow. The majority of malicious applications are designed to gain root access to the system, and the malware developers craft them so well that it is tough to detect them, and they keep on working in silence; users have no idea that the malware has endangered their system. After gaining control of these systems, these malicious applications can perform dangerous actions and can also infect other devices connected to the infected system. The developers of malicious applications are earning a considerable amount of money from this source. The Dark Web is one such example; it is a marketplace for criminals to buy and sell mobile malware, and the malware developers sell it as a component of software packages. On the Dark Web, malware and some other tools that are capable of evading many operating system like Android and iOS are available at a lower price, thereby gaining the interest of hackers and causing an increase in criminal activities. Malware has become a severe threat to modern society, which is increasingly becoming dependent on smart technologies for day-to-day activities. And the similar malware can also invade the OpenHarmony OS. Then make huge hurt to the users and the system. So it is necessary to find the way to protect users and operating system from attacks.

These vulnerabilities hiding in the system are the key or gate that usually make use of. The exploitation of permission, lack of awareness regarding security protocols, poor developer practices and coding skill, these are all possible factors that make vulnerability. So it is important to find the ways and methods to detect the vulnerability existing in the system efficiently. Reducing potential vulnerability and enhance the security mechanism could increase the difficulty that developers of malware to attack and steal users' privacy. That could protect the system and its' users efficiently.

## Scope and Backgroud of Research
Please identify key issue/problems to be addressed

OpenHarmony, also known as OHOS, stand as an open-source iteration of HarmonyOS. This innovative platform marks a new era in mobile operating systems. intended for deployment on smart devices such as smartphones and various embedded terminals. So the security issue of it is more than important. The key issue of this research is focus on how to enhance the security of Openharmony and its related applications.

In order to improve the security of OpenHarmony system and protect the system and its users, the first steps is to know and get familiar with the factors that threaten its security. In other words, we need to be familiar with the methods how to attack OpenHarmony OS. The categories of those attacks can be classified into four different categories based on the components of its targets. They are a). Hardware-based attacks, b). Kernel-based attacks, c). Hardware abstraction layer-based attacks and d). Applications-based attacks.

To attack the hardware, attacks target the vulnerabilites found in the hardware components. Most of the vulnerabilities exist because of the preinstalled vulnerable components provided by the manufactures. It is tough to protect the system from attacks that target such components. These vulnerabilities are very difficult to patch, because the patches are available with the distributors and carriers only.

A kernel is the heart of the mobile system. There is not the only choice of kernel to OpenHarmony, besides Linux Kernel, OpenHarmony also can use LiteOS as its kernel. Attacks targeting kernel are aimed at getting root access to the system and can cause severe damage. The kernel is directly or indirectly responsible for every action performed on the system and also for the management of different components. And it also takes care of the runtime environment (on OHOS, it's ark runtime) functionalities. Attackers are continually working in the direction of exploiting vulnerabilities in the kernel and related components like device drivers, memory, and JS VM(JavaScript Virtual Machine, counterpart as Android Runtime). Some kernel-based attacks target root privilege. These attacks target the vulnerabilities found in the kernel to exploit privileges. Another attacks that targeting memory. In these attacks, attackers exploits memory corruption vulnerability to alter the memory without giving instructions explicitly and then execute the malicious code that write into memory. There are also kernel-based attacks that target bootloader and device driver

The application-based attacks exploit the vulnerability of default applications as well as the applications installed into the system. Attackers take advantage of the exploited permissions and use attacks like privilege escalation, for exploiting the target system , at different level. Attackers are also misusing the flaws in native libraries and the third-party libraries found in the applications. They use these libraries to request for combined permissions. Escalated privilege rights give attackers access to any component of the victimâ€™s system, including the kernel. Attackers can even gain root privileges and can cause irreparable damage to the system. After sneaking into the system, attackers can spy on the userâ€™s data for personal motive or can sell it to third parties for money.

So, in order to reduce the exploitation of vulnerability, it is necessary for the researchers and developers to find out the new methods of detecting the potential vulnerability existing in the system or enhance the existed methods to cover more situations and speed them up, making them more efficient. The way to detect vulnerability can divide into two categories, the static method and the dynamic method.
