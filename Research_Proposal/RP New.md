### Project Objectives / Purpose of proposed investigation

The proposed investigation delves into the sphere of computer security, with a specific focus on bolstering the safeguarding of mobile systems, particularly within OpenHarmony OS.  

In the past 10 years, with technological enhancements and spreading, the number of mobile devices has increase greatly. Mobile devices, like IoT devices and smartphone, have entered the people daily life already, both for the personal and professional aspects of their lives. Statista forecast that, by 2023, there will be 4.3 billion smartphone users. OpenHarmony is an open-source version of HarmonyOS donated by Huawei to the OpenAtom Foundation. It is an operating system that designed for the smartphone, and also for the Internet of Things, wireless routers, tablet computers and other smart terminal devices. After nearly 4 years developing, OpenHarmony now releases the 4th version. It becomes wider and wider usage. However, the security issues are always huge problems that all the developers and users should take care of.

The cost competitiveness in the smartphone market has also contributed to the growth of the number of the devices and has made smartphone available to the middle- and lower-income groups as well. This availability and the features of the latest smartphone have make the population dependent on these phones for their daily work, such as paying house-hold through phone banking or transferring essential documents.

The operating system is an integral part of these smartphones and is responsible for the functioning of the device, which makes it prone to attacks that take control of the device. Hence, it becomes essential for the developers and researchers to enhance the ability of protecting from attacks and the ways to find out the potent vulnerability.

Malware families that are popular are spyware, bots, Adware, Potentially Unwanted Applications, Trojans, and Trojan spyware. PUA is the topmost Android malware detect by Quick Heal. In 2016, Kaspersky Lab detected 128886 lakh mobile banking Trojans and abround 261214 mobile Ransomware Trojans. Gugi is an example of a banking Trojan that can exploit the security policeis of Android Marshmalow. The majority of malicious applications are designed to gain root access to the system, and the malware developers craft them so well that it is tought to detect them, and they keep on working in silence; users have no idea that the malware has endangered their system. After gaining control of these systems, these malicious applications can perform dangerous actions and can also infect other devices connected to the infected system. The developers of malicious applications are earning a considerable amount of money from this source. The Dark Web is one such example; it is a marketplace for criminals to buy and sell mobile malware, and the malware developers sell it as a component of software packages. On the
