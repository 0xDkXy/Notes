### Project Objectives / Purpose of proposed investigation
#### origin

The proposed investigation delves into the sphere of computer security, with a specific focus on bolstering the safeguarding of mobile systems, particularly within OpenHarmony OS.  

In the past 10 years, with technological enhancements and spreading, the number of mobile devices has increase greatly. Mobile devices, like IoT devices and smartphone, have entered the people daily life already, both for the personal and professional aspects of their lives. Statista forecast that, by 2023, there will be 4.3 billion smartphone users. OpenHarmony is an open-source version of HarmonyOS donated by Huawei to the OpenAtom Foundation. It is an operating system that designed for the smartphone, and also for the Internet of Things, wireless routers, tablet computers and other smart terminal devices. After nearly 4 years developing, OpenHarmony now releases the 4th version. It becomes wider and wider usage. However, the security issues are always huge problems that all the developers and users should take care of.

The cost competitiveness in the smartphone market has also contributed to the growth of the number of the devices and has made smartphone available to the middle- and lower-income groups as well. This availability and the features of the latest smartphone have make the population dependent on these phones for their daily work, such as paying house-hold through phone banking or transferring essential documents.

The operating system is an integral part of these smartphones and is responsible for the functioning of the device, which makes it prone to attacks that take control of the device. Hence, it becomes essential for the developers and researchers to enhance the ability of protecting from attacks and the ways to find out the potent vulnerability.

Malware families that are popular are spyware, bots, Adware, Potentially Unwanted Applications, Trojans, and Trojan spyware. PUA is the topmost Android malware detect by Quick Heal. In 2016, Kaspersky Lab detected 128886 lakh mobile banking Trojans and abround 261214 mobile Ransomware Trojans. Gugi is an example of a banking Trojan that can exploit the security policeis of Android Marshmalow. The majority of malicious applications are designed to gain root access to the system, and the malware developers craft them so well that it is tough to detect them, and they keep on working in silence; users have no idea that the malware has endangered their system. After gaining control of these systems, these malicious applications can perform dangerous actions and can also infect other devices connected to the infected system. The developers of malicious applications are earning a considerable amount of money from this source. The Dark Web is one such example; it is a marketplace for criminals to buy and sell mobile malware, and the malware developers sell it as a component of software packages. On the Dark Web, malware and some other tools that are capable of evading many operating system like Android and iOS are available at a lower price, thereby gaining the interest of hackers and causing an increase in criminal activities. Malware has become a severe threat to modern society, which is increasingly becoming dependent on smart technologies for day-to-day activities. And the similar malware can also invade the OpenHarmony OS. Then make huge hurt to the users and the system. So it is necessary to find the way to protect users and operating system from attacks.

These vulnerabilities hiding in the system are the key or gate that usually make use of. The exploitation of permission, lack of awareness regarding security protocols, poor developer practices and coding skill, these are all possible factors that make vulnerability. So it is important to find the ways and methods to detect the vulnerability existing in the system efficiently. Reducing potential vulnerability and enhance the security mechanism could increase the difficulty that developers of malware to attack and steal users' privacy. That could protect the system and its' users efficiently.

The central focus of this proposed investigation is to delve into the realm of computer security, with a specific emphasis on bolstering the protection of mobile systems, particularly within the ambit of OpenHarmony OS.

Over the past decade, due to technological advancements and pervasive integration, the number of mobile devices has experienced an unprecedented surge. Mobile devices, including IoT devices and smartphones, have seamlessly woven themselves into people's daily lives, influencing both their personal and professional spheres. According to Statista's projections, the number of smartphone users is expected to reach a staggering 4.3 billion by 2023. OpenHarmony represents an open-source iteration of HarmonyOS, graciously donated by Huawei to the OpenAtom Foundation. Designed not only for smartphones but also for the Internet of Things, wireless routers, tablet computers, and other smart terminal devices, OpenHarmony has evolved through almost four years of development, culminating in its fourth version. Its usage is expanding at an exponential pace. Nonetheless, the persistent specter of security vulnerabilities remains a substantial challenge, demanding the vigilant attention of developers and users alike.

This research endeavor also recognizes the role of cost competitiveness in fostering the proliferation of smartphones, extending their accessibility to middle- and lower-income groups. These devices, characterized by their advanced features, have engendered a reliance on smartphones for essential daily tasks, such as mobile banking transactions and secure document transfers.

At the heart of this technological landscape lies the operating system, a foundational element responsible for the device's seamless operation. However, its critical role renders it susceptible to attacks that seek to compromise its integrity. Therefore, it becomes imperative for developers and researchers to fortify its defenses against potential breaches and vulnerabilities.

The contemporary threat landscape includes various categories of malware, such as spyware, bots, adware, Trojans, and Trojan spyware. One notorious example is the Gugi banking Trojan, which exploits Android Marshmallow's security policies. The surge in mobile malware is evident, with instances like Kaspersky Lab detecting over 128,886 lakh mobile banking Trojans and approximately 261,214 mobile Ransomware Trojans in 2016 alone. The majority of these malicious applications aim to gain root access to the system and operate stealthily, evading detection and wreaking havoc unbeknownst to users. Such threats not only compromise the infected system but can also propagate to other interconnected devices. Malicious software developers exploit this scenario, profiting from their activities through avenues like the Dark Webâ€”a marketplace for trading mobile malware as components of software packages.

These menaces have now permeated modern society, where reliance on smart technologies for everyday activities is ubiquitous. The proposed research acknowledges the potential intrusion of such malware into the OpenHarmony OS, which could have severe implications for users and the system. Therefore, the research's overarching goal is to develop strategies to protect both users and the operating system from these pernicious attacks.

The vulnerabilities embedded within systems often serve as the gateways exploited by attackers. Factors such as permissions exploitation, lack of awareness about security protocols, poor developer practices, and coding deficiencies can all contribute to vulnerability. Consequently, the research strives to identify efficient methods for detecting these vulnerabilities and mitigating their impact. By reducing potential vulnerabilities and enhancing security mechanisms, the research aims to increase the complexity of attacks, making it more challenging for malware developers to compromise user privacy and system integrity.

In summary, this research seeks to address the critical intersection of computer security and software engineering, concentrating on the imperative task of safeguarding mobile systems within the OpenHarmony OS framework. The ultimate aspiration is to contribute to a safer technological landscape, where the integrity and privacy of users remain uncompromised in the face of emerging threats.
