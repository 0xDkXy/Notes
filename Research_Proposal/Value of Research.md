#### Ransomware
Ransomware is one such malware family that once installed in the user's system, gives the control of the system to the attacker. The attacker then demands a huge ransom from the victim for releasing the data that otherwise attacker threatens to leak to the outside world.

#### Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA)
The attackers use third-party application stores and repacked applications to propagate these malicious programs. The extract the private information of the user, without his/her consent, and then send it to the server; later, the user this information for black marketing and social engineering purposes.

#### Trojan

**Example:** Gugi. Gugi is an example of a banking Trojan that can exploit the security policies of Android Marshmallow.
