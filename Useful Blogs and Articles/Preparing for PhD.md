When facing queries from an admissions committee about your lack of research experience in systems during a Computer Science Ph.D. interview, it's important to approach the situation strategically. Here are some steps and tips to effectively address this:

1. **Acknowledge the Gap**: Start by openly acknowledging the lack of direct research experience in systems. This shows self-awareness and honesty, which are valued traits in a research environment.

2. **Highlight Relevant Skills and Knowledge**: Emphasize the skills and knowledge you have gained through your focus on operating systems and computer architecture. Explain how these areas have foundational overlaps with systems research, such as understanding of low-level system operations, performance optimization, or hardware-software interaction.

3. **Discuss Transferable Skills**: Highlight any transferable skills that would be beneficial in systems research. These might include problem-solving abilities, proficiency in programming, analytical thinking, and experience with relevant tools or technologies.

4. **Show Enthusiasm and Willingness to Learn**: Express your enthusiasm for the field of systems and your eagerness to dive into research. Admissions committees often look for candidates who are passionate and willing to learn, even if they don't have direct experience.

5. **Mention Any Indirect Experience**: If you have any indirect experience that relates to systems (like projects, coursework, or internships), be sure to mention them. Even if they're not research-based, they can demonstrate relevant exposure and interest.

6. **Discuss Your Research Interests and Goals**: Clearly articulate your research interests within the systems field and how they align with the faculty's work or the university's research focus. This can help the committee see your potential contribution to their research community.

7. **Prepare a Thoughtful Question**: Have a thoughtful question ready about the systems research at the university or about how your background could fit into their ongoing projects. This shows engagement and serious consideration of your future role.

8. **Practice Your Responses**: Before the interview, practice answering questions about your lack of direct experience. This helps you to articulate your thoughts clearly and confidently during the actual interview.

Remember, Ph.D. programs are not just looking for candidates with perfect backgrounds; they are also looking for potential. Demonstrating your ability to learn, adapt, and contribute to new areas of research can be just as compelling as having direct experience.
